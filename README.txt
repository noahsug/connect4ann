  --Description:

    We implemented two neural network approaches for playing
    the game Connect 4. 

    The first neural network is based on 8-ply data (the first 
    8 moves in a game completed and the expected end result 
    if both players play optimally). We call this the 8-ply NN.

    The second neural network is based on game data that we
    generated by writing a playing heuristic and having it 
    play thousands of games and recording the result.
    We call this the Heuristic NN.

    Our application will play games between a combination of 
    player types:

        > a human player against one of the Neural Networks
        > a random-move AI against one of the Neural Networks
        > the Neural networks against each other

    You can specify which one you would like to try by 
    calling one of the Makefile options.


  --Source code:
    The source code is located in:
        datasets

  --Presentation slides:
    The presentation slides are: 
    Presentation_slides.pdf and Presentation_slides.pptx
    

  --TO RUN:
    
        cd datasets
        make usage

    This will list all of the makefile options for playing
    Connect 4 with different player combinations of a human player,
    computer (neural network) player, and random-move AI.
  
******************IMPORTANT TO NOTE:**********************************
*    Our application uses Matlab and the neural network toolboxes.
*    You must have both installed to properly run it.
*    We used the eceLinux computers to run the programs.
